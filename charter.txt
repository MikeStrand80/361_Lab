Hello this is our lab charter
1. Regarding disciplinary actions: 
Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group conscience, if 
decided by a majority vote. 
 
2. Disciplinary Log: 
The note taker will be responsible for logging any information on offenses committed by 
any member. This report will be sent out with the meeting notes every week so each 
member knows where they stand.  
 
3. Minor Group Offence: 
A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. Minor 
offecnces will be discussed as a group with the offender in question. Group expectations 
wil be reitterated to ensure all group members are on the same page.
 
4. Major Group Offence: 
A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for 
accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. Major offences will be discussed with the group
and TA as a moderator. A solutioin to the issue in question will be agreed upon by end of 
meeting.
 
5. Punishment and Dismissal: 
A group member committing enough minor and major offences will finally have gone to 
the dark side and demoted to Darth Vader. They will be referred to punishment and 
dismissal and will be given over to review by the TA and governing bodies (the Rock). 
An email describing the offences leading up to punishment and dismissal will be.
