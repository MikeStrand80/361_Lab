Work Norms:
1. Time commitment required by each group member :
Time commitment is a difficult thing to determine seeing one member may be able to
complete the same job in a less amount of time. The goal is to complete the job. If one
member is taking a substantial amount of time more than the others, it will be examined
by the group as to whether his work load should be decreased.

2. Dealing with different work habits:
The work habits of any particular member will not be an issue as long as the member
communicates progress, produces quality work, and the work is done by the dates
established by the group. If the member does not meet these standards, procedures to deal
with that member are further detailed in the ground rules.

3. Keeping up with communication:
Each member will be expected to be consistent with attending meetings and sharing what they have accomplished according to SRUM guidelines. 
All memebers will be expected to inform if they cannot attend a meeting about 24 hours beforehand, and be consistent with keeping up with their assigned work.
